✅ 1. Add Files Section
Use this to upload:

README.md — Your project overview.

vite.config.ts — For glob imports.

package.json — To track dependencies and scripts.

src/pages/*.tsx — Core section files like Hero.tsx, Contact.tsx, etc.

/posts/*.md — Your blog article Markdown files.

public/resume.pdf — Your downloadable CV.

Optional: You can include screenshots (like UI designs or issues), and .env (sanitized) for context.

✅ 2. Instructions / Declaration
I’ll update and maintain this as your working build documentation. You should declare:

Your site purpose: e.g., “To showcase my full-stack development portfolio using React + Tailwind + Markdown blog.”

Your deployment link: GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

Any key tools or services used: EmailJS, Formspree, Webhook.site, etc.

Blog configuration: Markdown loader, slug routing, etc.

Would you like me to generate a fresh README or README.md structure to reflect this as well?
